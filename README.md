This is my personal page project. It uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as a framework and [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io) for content management. Take a look also at the [Sanity project](https://github.com/Islamantin/islamantin.page-sanity-project) in my github repository.

This project is deployed on Vercel with custom domain name. You can visit it at https://islamantin.page.
